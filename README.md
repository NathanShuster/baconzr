# baconzr
Code for an ugly, but functional website that I made for my high school programming teammates back in 2014. Backend is GAE w/memcache and templates are handled by jinja2. Includes code for users, posts, comments on posts, basic security (salted and hashed password storage), and (basic) version control for the team code.

The name for this project comes from our team, BACON (Best All-round Club Of Nerds) and the competition it was designed for, <a href="http://zerorobotics.mit.edu/">ZeroRobotics</a> (abbreviated ZR).
